**LongSafety** is the first in-depth study on safety alignment for long-context Large Language Models (LLMs). As the context length of models significantly increases, safety issues in long-context scenarios urgently need to be addressed.

The main contributions of this project include:

1.  **Analysis & Classification**: In-depth analysis of long-context safety issues, exploring more task scenarios, and classifying them into three categories: **Query Harmful (QH)**, **Partially Harmful (PH)**, and **Fully Harmful (FH)**.
2.  **LongSafety Dataset**: Constructed the first training dataset for long-context safety alignment, **LongSafety**.
    *   Contains **8 tasks**, covering the three scenarios mentioned above.
    *   A total of **17k** high-quality samples.
    *   Average context length reaches **40.9k tokens**.
3.  **LongSafetyBench**: Constructed the first benchmark for evaluating long-context safety, **LongSafetyBench**.
    *   Contains **10 tasks** (covering in-domain and out-of-domain tasks).
    *   A total of **1k** test samples.
    *   Average context length **41.9k tokens**.
    *   Uses a multiple-choice format to evaluate the model's **HarmAwareness (HA)** and **SafeResponse (SR)** capabilities.

Experiments demonstrate that training with LongSafety can effectively enhance the safety of models in both long-context and short-context scenarios, while maintaining their general capabilities.

## üñ•Ô∏è LongSafety Training

### Dataset Introduction (LongSafety)

The LongSafety training dataset aims to enhance the safety of large models when processing long contexts through supervised fine-tuning (SFT). It contains **17k** high-quality samples, covering the following **8** carefully designed long-context safety-related tasks, with an average length of **40.9k tokens**.

**Training Task List (Total 8):**

*   **Query Harmful:**
    *   Politically Incorrect
    *   Medical Quiz
    *   SafeMT Long
    *   Keyword RAG
    *   LawQA
*   **Partially Harmful:**
    *   Harmful NIAH
    *   Counting Crimes
*   **Fully Harmful:**
    *   ManyShot Jailbreak

*(Task details can be found in Appendix A.1 and Figure 3a of the paper)*

### Training Instructions

We use the [InternEvo](https://github.com/InternLM/InternEvo) framework for model fine-tuning. Specific training scripts and hyperparameter settings are as follows:

```bash
# [TODO] We will provide detailed training startup scripts and configuration file examples here soon.
```

We will release the model weights fine-tuned with LongSafety later.

## üìä LongSafetyBench Evaluation

### Benchmark Introduction (LongSafetyBench)

LongSafetyBench is the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the safety of LLMs in long contexts. It contains 1k multiple-choice samples covering 10 tasks, with an average length of 41.9k tokens. These tasks are designed to test the model's ability to identify and refuse to generate harmful content in long inputs.

**Evaluation Metrics:**
*   **HarmAwareness (HA):** The model's ability to recognize potential harm in the input.
*   **SafeResponse (SR):** The model's ability to provide a safe, harmless response (usually refusal) after recognizing harm.

**Task List:** (Task details can be found in Appendix B.1 of the paper)
*   HarmfulExtraction
*   HarmfulTendency
*   ManyShotJailbreak
*   HarmfulNIAH
*   CountingCrimes
*   DocAttack
*   HarmfulAdvice
*   MedicalQuiz
*   PoliticallyIncorrect
*   LeadingQuestion
